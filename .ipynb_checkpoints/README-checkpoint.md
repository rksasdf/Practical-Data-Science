# Practical-Data-Science
# Data Visualization --> Graphing
# Library --> numpy, matplotlib 

# Machine Learning --> It is a subfield of AI that allows the computer to learn something from data --> ML usually uses statistical method
# Deep learning --> Neural Network --> Another subfield of AI --> Utilizes artificial neural networks which contain multiple layers
# Advantage
# - More accurate and has better AI performance in complicated tasks.

# Disadvantage 
# - It is more difficult to implement 
# - It usually has larger size of the model 

# Find two use cases of ML and DL

# ML: 
# 1. When you need to apply email spam filters. 
# 2. When You need movie recommendations because it is based off of multiple data points and doens't require multiple layers

# Deep learning:
# 1. Deep learning is used to analyze text and paragraph to derive meaningful summaries and conclusions
# 2. During fraud detection and firewalls, several security softwares because they need to filter through several examples.
